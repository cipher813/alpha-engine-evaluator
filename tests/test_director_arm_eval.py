"""Tests for evals/director_arm_eval.py — the Director's arm comparison.

These pin the SCORING and the VERDICT, which is the part that has to be right
when the arms actually differ. The live calls are exercised by running the
harness; nothing here makes one.

The failure this guards against is specific and has a precedent in this fleet:
on 2026-09-08 a collapsed predictor champion was promoted past a veto whose
incumbent side WAS the candidate, so every ratio came out 1.0 by construction
and the comparison could not have failed. A comparison that cannot return
"rejected" is not a comparison.
