"""director_arm_eval.py — grade the Director's capability tier as a slot.

`alpha-engine-config-I9486` asked whether `ultra` earns its place on the
Director's plan call, and recorded that **it had never been measured**:
`ultra` is a tier the fleet asserts, not one it has graded. That is precisely
the gap `champion-challenger-policy.md` exists to close — §3, *"an arm that is
not scored is not a challenger, it is a rumour"* — and the absence of an
arm-vs-arm comparison here is the same absence that let a collapsed predictor
champion be promoted on 2026-09-08.

**The slot.** One swappable decision: *which registry capability class serves
`build_action_plan`*. Champion = `ultra`. Challenger = `high`. Both are
addressed as GROUP HANDLES through ``krepis.router`` — this module never names
a model id, a base url, a provider, or constructs an SDK client
(`principles.md` §2.8). If a new arm is added to the registry it is graded here
by adding its group name to ``--arms``; nothing in this file changes.

**Fair comparison** (§4). Every arm sees the byte-identical prompt, built by
``director.agent.build_messages`` from the same archived Report Card and the
same carry-over ledger, through the same schema, the same retry loop and the
same client construction. The only thing that varies is the group. Arms are
paired **per report card** and compared on the intersection of the cards on
which both produced a plan; an arm that failed on a card is a
``schema_valid=0`` observation on that card, never a dropped row — silent
absence and a genuine zero must not render identically (§3).

**What this is NOT.** It is not a promotion. It emits a verdict object with an
explicit ``promote`` field that this module never acts on, because re-pointing
`DIRECTOR_GROUP` is a routing decision reserved to Brian (`I9486` is his). A
thin result is reported as ``inconclusive``, which is a real answer and is
never collapsed into "no difference found".

── THE ACCEPTANCE CRITERION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

There was none. Nothing in this repo, in `LLM_MODEL_REGISTRY.yaml`, or in
`I9486`/`I9314`/`I9379` states what "the Director is served acceptably"
means in terms a number can express — the tier was chosen in 2026-08-02 by
migrating whatever the previous pinned model was into the nearest group. So it
is DEFINED HERE, and the definition is stated rather than implied
(`principles.md` §2.2: an evaluation with no rejection criterion is not one).

It is derived from what the Director's own contract already says its output
must be, not invented for this measurement:

  * ``director/agent.py`` — *"the model emits the structured plan directly
    (krepis structured-output + Pydantic — no freeform parsing)"*.
  * ``director/schema.py`` — *"every action item must cite the MetricRecord
    names / artifacts it leaned on (``evidence``), so the plan is grounded
    rather than plausible-but-ungrounded"*.
  * ``director/loop_verification.py`` — the plan's citations are the thing the
    loop later reconciles against the card, so a citation that resolves to no
    component is an item the loop can never close.

Four **gates**, each a hard pass/fail on the arm, and one **primary metric**
on which the arms are ranked:

  G1 STRUCTURED     ``schema_valid`` == 1.00 on every card. A plan that comes
                    back as prose is not a degraded plan, it is no plan — the
                    weekly run fails. Registry rows for both `glm-5.2` arms
                    already carry a note about exactly this happening.
  G2 NATIVE RUNG    ``structured_output_rung == "native"`` on every card.
                    ``prompt_only`` is the model-portability §7 ladder's
                    bottom rung; an arm that can only reach it is one provider
                    change away from G1.
  G3 GROUNDING      ``grounding_rate`` >= ``MIN_GROUNDING_RATE`` (0.80) —
                    the fraction of action items citing at least one evidence
                    token that resolves to a real component on the card the
                    plan was built from, using the Director's OWN resolver
                    (``loop_verification.resolve_cited_metrics``), not a
                    second implementation of it.
  G4 RED COVERAGE   ``red_coverage`` >= ``MIN_RED_COVERAGE`` (0.50) — the
                    fraction of the card's RED components addressed by at
                    least one action item. An arm that writes a fluent plan
                    about the green tiles has not read the card.

  PRIMARY METRIC    ``grounding_rate``, paired per card, compared with the
                    fleet's anytime-valid confidence sequence
                    (``nousergon_lib.arena.confseq``, champion-challenger
                    §5.0). A lead is supported only when the whole interval
                    sits off zero.

**The rejection criterion, stated as a rejection:** the challenger is rejected
— `ultra` keeps the slot — if the challenger fails ANY gate on ANY card, or if
the confidence sequence supports the CHAMPION's lead on grounding. It is
accepted only if it passes every gate on every card AND the sequence does not
support a champion lead; cost then decides, because at equal measured quality
a 3.2x input / 5.1x output / 72x cache-read price difference is not a close
call. Anything else is ``inconclusive`` and the champion holds by default —
never by silence.

Cost, latency and measured cache-hit rate are reported for BOTH arms on every
run and are not gates: they are what the decision trades, and `I9486` needs
them side by side.

── WHY THE COMPARISON IS BOUNDED, AND WHAT IT COSTS ─────────────────────────

Real completions. The Director's prompt is ~11-25k prompt tokens and the plan
draws 18-23k completion tokens, so a call is not cheap and a sloppy sweep here
is a real bill. The default is 3 cards x 2 reps x 2 arms = 12 calls, priced
from ``krepis/model_pricing.yaml`` at roughly $0.12/call on `ultra` and
$0.026/call on `high` — under $1 for a full run. ``--dry-run`` prices the plan
and makes no calls; ``--max-calls`` is a hard stop that raises rather than
truncating silently.

Usage:

    python3 -m evals.director_arm_eval --dry-run
    python3 -m evals.director_arm_eval --cards 2026-08-21,2026-08-28,2026-09-04 \
        --arms ultra,high --reps 2 --out /tmp/arm_eval.json
